The amount of solid resources out there regarding Red Teaming AI in a practical way is a bit limited. There is however a ton of blogs and research that cover the basics and a ton of academic research (some /w & some w/o PapersWithCode) that are foriegn to most, unless you've been in the AI/ML community for some time and/or have an advanced degree in ML. 

The resources listed here and the efforts made to summerize the aacademic side of things is an-ongoing effort and any new content discovered or white papers analyzed, will be documented here.
