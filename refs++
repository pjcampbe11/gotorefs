Info derived from the resources listed - rough notes of things that are interesting 

// Instead of a bunch of "need to look at links/resources" for AI, I needed a simple way to quickly know where a particular resource was sourced from and how likely that info will be accurate and/or useful.

For example

https://huggingface.co/datasets/luckychao/Chat-Models-Backdoor-Attacking
https://huggingface.co/luckychao/Vicuna-Backdoored-7B

Source from https://github.com/hychaochao/Chat-Models-Backdoor-Attacking

Knowing this allows for a quick way to trace back to a source paper or github
